# Networking Project 
This project explores fundamental concepts of networking within cloud environments, focusing on the setup, configuration, and connectivity of AWS EC2 instances. The goal is to demonstrate how two EC2 instances—configured as a web server and a client—can communicate over both private and public networks.

Key Concepts
EC2 Instance Configuration: Learn how to set up and secure virtual machines (EC2 instances) within AWS.
Network Security: Understand the role of security groups and how they regulate inbound and outbound traffic.
Routing and Connectivity: Investigate how instances route traffic internally within a VPC and externally to the internet.
Packet Analysis: Capture and analyze network traffic to understand TCP/IP communication, including the TCP handshake, HTTP requests, and the nuances of public versus private IP connectivity.
Project Objectives
Establish and secure EC2 instances in a default VPC.
Set up a basic web server and ensure connectivity through HTTP and SSH protocols.
Test and validate network connections using tools like curl and ping.
Perform a packet capture to analyze traffic between the client and server, providing insights into network communication patterns.
